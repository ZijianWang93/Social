README
==========
This is the front end iOS application for Social Network with events posting and searching functions. Source code of back end is stored in
[Back-End for Social](https://github.com/ZijianWang93/SocialBackend)

Demo Requirements
---------
1. The application was tested locally by Xcode 8.

2. Please enter the project by
```
Social/Social.xcworkspace
```

Possible Issues
---------
1. The back end sever is active now, thus there is nothing needing any updating. If the back end is terminated, the connection link in SCPostManager.m should be updated. There is a comment above the link:
```
  // update if necessary
```
